`This project analyzes cost report data from U.S. nursing homes (2015–2021) to help identify facilities suitable for investment. It was completed as part of the BANA 620: Predictive Analytics course at California State University, Northridge.`

**`Objective`**

`To build a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a nursing home is a viable investment, using operational and financial metrics from CMS cost reports.`
